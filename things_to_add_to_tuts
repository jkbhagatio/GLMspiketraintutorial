Tut1:
	- why STA is biased estimator for G-GLM, and why WSTA is not
	- finish section 8: reviewing model performance via different measures
	- advanced exercise: define custom: 1) model, 2) likelihood function for this model, 3) optimization algo to find best-fit params for likelihood function for model
	- how does maximizing likelihood compare to minimizing error function
	- why does model with greater likelihood for a given dataset not always have higher performance (r^2) for that same dataset?
