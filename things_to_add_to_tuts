Tut1:
	- why STA is biased estimator for G-GLM, and why WSTA is not?
	- finish section 8: reviewing model performance via different measures
	- advanced exercise: define custom: 1) model, 2) likelihood function for this model, 3) optimization algo to find best-fit params for likelihood function for model
	- how does maximizing likelihood compare to minimizing error function? -> we minimize an error function when we deem maximizing likelihood too hard: what is a concrete example of this?
	- add f-vals and p-vals

Tut2:
	- finish section 6: reviewing model performance via different measures
	- finish section 5: complete "full population" model of coupled GLMs.

Tut4:
	- see how optimization functions (e.g. neg likelihood) actually run / compute optimized params

- change `assert(round...` statements to `assert(ismembertol...`
- how can we predict multiple outputs from glm?
